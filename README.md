# PTOnboarding

## Overview

**PTOnboarding** is an iOS application developed using SwiftUI and Swift Data. The primary goal of this project is to provide users with personalized recommendations for personal trainers based on their unique fitness goals and preferences. By leveraging a sophisticated search algorithm and user profiling during the onboarding process, PTOnboarding helps users find the best matches for personal trainers who align with their specific needs and objectives.

- **Advanced Search Algorithm:** 
  - A custom search algorithm processes the user data to find and recommend the most relevant personal trainers.
  - The algorithm considers multiple factors, including the trainers’ expertise, availability, and previous client feedback, to ensure the best possible match.

- **SwiftUI Interface:** 
  - The app is built entirely with SwiftUI, ensuring a modern and responsive user interface.
  - Seamless user experience with smooth navigation and a visually appealing design.
